  "explain": "In Korean folklore, a Dokkaebi is neither a ghost nor a human. They are mysterious beings who show up at night to play tricks, surprise people, or sometimes even help them.\n\nJust like a Dokkaebi, this web app is full of fun, unexpected image tools. You might find yourself thinking, “Wait, it can do that?” or “Haha, that’s actually funny.”\n\nMost of the tools here may not be essential for everyone — but for some people, they might be surprisingly useful.\n\nGot a cool idea? Feel free to reach out anytime.",
